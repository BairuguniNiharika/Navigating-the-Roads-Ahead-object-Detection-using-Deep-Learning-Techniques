# Navigating-the-Roads-Ahead-object-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
This Project introduces a novel combination framework designed to address the limitations of current object detectors, particularly when it comes to detecting overlapping and small objects within images. By integrating two renowned detection models, Faster R-CNN and YOLO, our approach demonstrates a notable improvement in the detection of objects, providing more accurate bounding boxes and increasing the overall number of detected objects.
